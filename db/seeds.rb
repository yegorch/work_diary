# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# may_week.days.create([
#   2.7.8 :010 >   { day_of_week: 1, work_start: "10:00", work_end: "19:00", break_
#   duration: 60 },
#   2.7.8 :011 >   { day_of_week: 2, work_start: "10:00", work_end: "19:00", break_
#   duration: 60 },
#   2.7.8 :012 >   { day_of_week: 4, work_start: "10:00", work_end: "19:00", break_
